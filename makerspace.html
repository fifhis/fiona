          <p>The results of our feild work research showed that 63.9% took over a minute to sign in, 30.6% ignored the kiosk, and 5.8% needed to sign waivers. These findings point to inefficiencies and confusion in the current system, indicating a need for improvements.</p>

      <p>We conducted interviews with staff members and students to gain insights into their experiences while navigating the Makerspace. The feedback received from these individuals provided valuable qualitative data about the specific challenges users encounter. This information will guide us in determining the appropriate approaches to address these issues effectively.</p>

    <p>The redesigned prototype addresses feedback gathered from user interviews by enhancing the sign-in 
      experience. It features a more intuitive interface on the kiosk that guides students through the 
      process: <strong>returning users are promptly directed to sign in, while new users are navigated 
      towards waiver signing</strong>. Additionally, <strong>clear instructions</strong> are displayed for both processes, 
      ensuring ease of use. To further assist students, the option to <strong>seek help </strong>from staff members 
      is prominently incorporated, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience..</p>
