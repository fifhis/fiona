                <h1>Animators</h1>
                <p>We decided to create a prototype for an animation app that integrates <strong>tutorials and guides</strong> on essential animation principles, the utilization of <strong>AI technology</strong>, and various features that help beginner animators enjoy their animating journey!</p>

            <div class="description">
              <p>In current animating apps, users are often <strong>left without built-in tutorials</strong> within the software. The absence of guidance on animation principles means users must seek information elsewhere, which can be a <strong>time-consuming and frustrating</strong> process.</p>

      <p><span>AI Suggeting Frames</span></span></p>   
      <p>To ease the workload for users, our software includes an AI Suggesting Frames feature. This tool generates intermediate frames between two original drawings, significantly reducing the effort required to create numerous animation frames. The animation process is divided into two tasks: "in-betweens" and "key frames." <br>Users can focus on creating the key frames while the AI handles the in-betweens, ensuring smooth and cohesive animations. </p>

    <p><span>Premade Assets and Animation Stylization</span></span></p>   
    <p>Traditional keyframe animation requires meticulous editing of keyframes and in-between frames. Our solution simplifies this by allowing users to use premade objects.  Moreover, animation stylizations can be easily applied to the object, bypassing  the tedious work and immediately animating the objects. </p>
